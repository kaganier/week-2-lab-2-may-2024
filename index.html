        <h2>Writing as a hobby</h2>
        <p>I developed a heart for writing around the age of 8. When I discovered I had a talent for writing poetry and songs. It eventually grew into a love of story telling.
            The stories would be about my life that I kept in a journal. I still to this day have a passion for writing with a library of about 20 journals filled with ideas.
